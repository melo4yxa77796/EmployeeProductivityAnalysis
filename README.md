# ðŸ’¼ Employee Attrition Analysis

This project focuses on understanding employee attrition using HR analytics data from IBM.  
We analyze key factors that contribute to employees leaving the company, such as:

- Job satisfaction
- Work-life balance
- Department
- Gender
- Monthly income
- Promotion 

The dataset used is from [IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset).
